            I returned to China from Canada a week ago. I had to spend 14 days alone in the hotel because of Covid-19. I can't go out, but I can look out by the window. I live in a room on the first floor and I find a little yellow dog that appears outside my window every day, so I feed it meat and talk to it every day. He may not understand me, but he still comes every day and wags his tail at me. It's so cute, it makes me not lonely anymore.
